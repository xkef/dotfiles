# Create a commit in a repository

## Git commits

In a Git repository, run `command git diff` to see the
changes and `command git diff --staged` to see what the
index already holds. Stage the files that belong to the
commit with `git add <file>...`. Every change belongs
unless the user names a subset.

## Jujutsu commits

A `.jj` directory in the repository root marks a Jujutsu
repository. Jujutsu has no staging area. Any `jj` command
snapshots the working directory, untracked files included,
so ask the user which changed files belong in the change.
Run `jj st` to list the files in the current snapshot and
`jj show` to see the diff. Then run `jj split <file>...`
with the commit message in `-m` to commit those files.

Because of the missing staging area, treat every `jj`
command that creates or edits a change with care. When the
user asks to squash changes into the last commit with
`jj squash`, ask which files' changes to squash and run
`jj squash <file>...` with those files.

For more on Jujutsu, see the `jj` skill.

## Common instructions

1. Run the Git or Jujutsu commands that show what belongs
   in the commit.
2. Never commit plan files under `.claude-notes/`. The
   global `~/.config/git/ignore` file ignores that
   directory. Plan files stay local.
3. Draft a commit message in the format below. Never
   include prompt text or generated-by attribution.
4. **Always** show the proposed commit message to the user
   and wait for their approval before committing. They may
   want to edit it first. Don't run the commit command
   until they confirm.

## Commit message format

- Subject: use `type: description` or
  `type(scope): description`. Aim for 50 characters, with
  a hard limit of 72 for the whole subject. Use lowercase,
  imperative mood, and no final period. The subject states
  what the commit does, such as `fix(zsh): restore history`.
- Scope: optional, such as `feat(tmux)` or `fix(zsh)`.
- Body: add one only when the motivation needs explaining.
  Separate it from the subject with a blank line and wrap
  at 72 characters. Explain why the change matters. Keep
  it brief and don't repeat what the diff shows.
- Footer: separate it from the body, or from the subject
  without a body, with a blank line. Use the
  fields below when they apply.

### Footer fields

- `Breaking-Change:`: describe the incompatible change
  and any required migration.
- `Co-Authored-By: Name <email>`: credit a known coauthor.
  Use their real name and email. Never invent attribution.
- `Refs:`: identify the issues or other work items this
  commit advances, such as a PR, task, or specification.
  Use known IDs, URLs, or paths from the task context, such
  as `Refs: #123` or `Refs: TEAM-456, docs/spec.md`.
  Omit this field when no related work item exists. Never
  invent a reference.

## Conventional Commits types

| Type     | When to use                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| feat     | New features                              |
| fix      | Bug fixes                                 |
| refactor | Code improvements with no behavior change |
| docs     | Documentation, including code comments    |
| test     | Add or change tests                       |
| perf     | Performance improvements                  |
| style    | Formatting and lint fixes                 |
| chore    | Maintenance, dependencies, and tooling    |

## Example

```text
fix(zsh): preserve history across sessions

Concurrent shells can overwrite each other's history, losing commands
needed in later sessions.

Refs: #123
```
