macOS and Arch Linux dotfiles, applied by one fish script, `setup/apply`.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xkef/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/setup/bootstrap
```

Bootstrap installs the `core` packages, which bring fish, then runs
`setup/apply`. After that, `dots apply` runs it again. Each run prints its
pipeline and then works through it:

```text
  1 packages  install each module's package list
  2 links     link modules/<module>/ into ~
  3 private   unpack private/home.tar.age (desktop)
  4 agents    link the shared skills, seed pi settings (agents)
  5 system    file modes, sockets, and jj in this checkout
  6 macos     apply the macOS defaults (desktop on macOS)
  7 shell     make fish the login shell
  8 theme     apply the current theme
  9 zoxide    add every repo to zoxide
```

Each step can run again without harm, so a rerun repairs whatever drifted.
`dots diff` prints the link changes without making them.

The machine's state lives in `~/.local/state/dotfiles`, which the repo links as
`state/`:

- `modules` selects the modules under `modules/`. A machine gets `core`,
  `desktop`, and `agents`, and the Lima VM gets `core` and `agents`. The extras
  `wezterm`, `helix`, `zed`, and `kickstart` go in by hand.
- `links` lists every link the last run made, so a file removed from the repo
  loses its link.
- `backup/` holds the files that stood where a link goes.

## Keys

Neovim uses `Space` as leader, and WezTerm and tmux use `Ctrl-Space`. `leader ?`
lists the bindings. `dots theme` switches the colors of every themed tool at
once.

## Agent sandbox

`claude` and `pi` start in a [nono](https://nono.sh) sandbox, whose credential
proxy adds the Claude and GitHub tokens to requests. `agents vm` runs Claude
Code in a [Lima](https://lima-vm.io) VM behind the same proxy. Store the tokens
once:

```sh
claude setup-token  # then store its output:
security add-generic-password -s nono -a claude_code_oauth_token -w
security add-generic-password -s nono -a github-<gh user> -w
security add-generic-password -s nono -a openrouter_api_key -w  # pi
# Linux: secret-tool store --label=nono service nono account github-<gh user>
```

pi starts on DeepSeek V4.1 Flash through OpenRouter. Its footer shows the
session's cost, and the status line shows the key's spend today and this month.

## Private files

Private files, such as the git identity, live in `private/home.tar.age`, an
[age](https://age-encryption.org) archive whose key sits in 1Password. A desktop
apply unpacks it into `$HOME`, next to the configs that include each file.
`mise run encrypt <file>` adds or updates one.
